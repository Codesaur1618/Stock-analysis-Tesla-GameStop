# Stock Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview

This project is a data analysis and visualization effort aimed at helping customers make informed investment decisions in stocks. The analysis focuses on popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. The project extracts historical share price and quarterly revenue data, processes it, and presents the findings in a dashboard format.

## Goals of the Project

As a Data Scientist/Data Analyst, I worked on achieving the following objectives:

### Data Collection

I used Python libraries and web scraping techniques to gather historical share price data and quarterly revenue reports for Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. The data was sourced from various reliable sources to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

### Data Preprocessing

The collected data underwent preprocessing, which included cleaning, handling missing values, and structuring it into a format suitable for analysis.

### Data Analysis

Using Python, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the financial data. This involved exploring trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to gain insights into the performance of each stock.

### Data Visualization

To make the insights easily digestible, I created interactive dashboards. Visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly were employed to represent the data visually.
